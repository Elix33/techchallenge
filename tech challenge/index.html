        <h2>About the Kingdom</h2>
        <p>Colchis is known in Greek mythology as the destination of the Argonauts, as well as the home to Medea and the Golden Fleece.
          It was also described as a land rich with gold, iron, timber and honey that would export its resources mostly to ancient Hellenic city-states
          Colchis was populated by Colchians, an early Kartvelian-speaking tribe ancestral to the contemporary western Georgians, namely Svans and Zans.
          Its geography is mostly assigned to what is now the western part of Georgia and encompasses the present-day Georgian provinces of Samegrelo, Imereti, Guria, Adjara, Abkhazia, Svaneti, Racha; modern Russia's Sochi and Tuapse districts; and present-day Turkeyâ€™s Artvin, Rize, and Trabzon provinces.
